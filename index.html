            <p>
                virtualDissent_hyper.txt comprises six hypertext pieces which utilize the inherencies of the medium to elicit a multiplicity of experiential subjectivities from users, visitors, and, in some cases, the artists themselves. Hypertext describes software
                systems which establish links between pieces of information, most often through mouse click. As an artistic medium, hypertext lends itself to multiplicity of narrative, of identity, and of outcome.

            <p>
                These artists access such multiplicities through both the choice of hypertext as a medium and a particular emphasis on exploring participation, disrupting the boundary between artist, creator, and user. The artists use their influence as creators to guide
                rather than command the audience, pushing them toward momentary encounters with power-resistant act, that is, acts which resist the disciplinary power described by Foucault, which is “. . .more dependent upon bodies and what they do .
                . . which permits time and labour . . . to be extracted from bodies . . . [and] which is constantly exercised by means of surveillance” (Foucault, 1947, pg. 104). These acts do not happen at the superficial aesthetic of the piece, but
                rather emerge as effects of the interaction between creator, system, and audience to be observed at the levels of subtext and gestalt. Such levels might be better understood as that which emerges at the moment of interaction, as “determined
                not only by the actual potentials of the interaction system but also by their interpretation by the meanings ascribed to them by the recipient” (Kwastek, 2013, pp. 28-29).

            <p>
                Interwoven with resistance, these pieces and their artists and audiences, thus, enter into the political conversations surrounding such issues as identity, sexuality, love, race, gender, socioeconomic inequality, queerness, death, anonymity, and bodily
                autonomy. In this way, virtualDissent_hyper.txt invites visitors to engage with the sometimes-uncomfortable reality of how we submit to and resist the norms and pressures of our time.
