                From there, the player experiences elaborate fictions as different characters. Sometimes clicking on a hyperlink moves the player forward in the plot, sometimes it elaborates a description of the setting or characters, and sometimes it leads to somewhere
                that is nowhere.

                After each experience, the player sleeps, and must eat and drink before entering the next experience. Repetition of action, rhythm of the links, and the separation between the established reality and alternate realities are analogous to many lived experiences
                and perhaps critical of virtual reality technologies.
