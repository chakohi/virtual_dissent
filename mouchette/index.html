            A profile for a pre-pubescent female artist greets users on the landing page and invites them to explore the profile through links to different pages. Based loosely on Georges Bernanos 1937 book Nouvelle Historie de Mouchette and Robert Bresson’s 1967
            movie Mouchette, the website features much taboo content that is sexualized, morbid, and suicidal. In both previous pieces, the main character, a young teenager named Mouchette, experiences rejection, rape, and her mother’s death before committing
            suicide. However while such content embodies the darker effects of internet anonymity, other pages offer touching reminders of the positive way it can be wielded. Hence, the avatar allows both creator and user to explore the malleability of
            cyber-identity. Invitations to provide names and email addresses offer users the opportunity to mimic the creator in their manipulation of identity, joining the “Mouchette Network.” Anonymous, active participation provokes the audience-artist-apparatus
            relationship, and elicits the questions of the purpose and effects of using the internet to interrogate mental health and identity issues. The maintenance of the creator’s anonymity for 14 years provided time for the piece to grow under public
            scrutiny and space of a multiplicity of potential characters to manifest for each visitor. Though the work was attributed to Martine Neddam in 2010, Mouchette continues to interact with visitors.

            Mouchette is one of three of Neddam’s anonymously created virtual characters with autonomous artistic existences. Each character, including David Still(2001) and XiaoQian(2006), simulates and archives dialogue between the character and visitors and between
            different visitors, making them more communication facilitators than momentary, stagnant profiles. These pieces emerged from a long-standing and ongoing exploration of language as a raw material for art with several Neddam’s early works, such
            as There Is No Copyright On Laws (1994) and Walk on Me featuring installations of text into space. After relinquishing anonymity of her virtual characters, Neddam has brought this work into the public space and experimented with new ways of
            creating characters. Her most recent and ongoing work is MyDesktopLife (2014). She holds teaching positions at Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam and the University of Quebec in Montreal in Visual and Media Arts.
