                After clicking the blue link to start the game, a ten-second timer starts to count down to the end of an intimate narrative. The length of the narrative is determined by the speed with which the user can understand the contents of the grey-text paragraphs,
                choose their responses from the links provided, and click the links. When the timer reaches zero, the game ends, and the player is left with whatever fleeting intimacy they could find. A game competition, Ludum Dare, with a theme of “ten
                seconds,” inspired the work built with Twine.

                In what might be redundantly described as its queering of love, queers in love at the end of the world allows each user to explore a variety of experiences of love. Its narratives lean into each way to love while allowing the time pressure to leave room
                only for the user’s perspective. Thus, over each iteration of the game, the user has the opportunity to think about and perhaps expand the way they want to love. It is through this space for subjectivity and oscillation between ultimatum
                and forgiveness, that this piece playfully disrupts what a love act must be. The artist Anna Anthropy is a transgender video game developer whose works focus on queer narratives. One of her main video game mediums are RPGs which range
                in categories from anime, to fashion. Her works typically touch on relevant queer topics and tropes such as queer relationships ending in tragedy, or simply promoting other aspects in the queer community besides a homosexual male relationship.
                Anna Anthropy also likes to create puzzle games, some lesser known interactive fiction, and short writings or “zines” as she calls them.
